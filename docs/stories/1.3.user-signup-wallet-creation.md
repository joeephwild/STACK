# Story 1.3: User Sign-Up and Wallet Creation

## Status
**Current Status:** Approved
**Assigned To:** Dev Agent
**Sprint:** Epic 1 - Foundation & User Onboarding
**Story Points:** 8
**Priority:** High

## Story
**As a** new user,
**I want** to easily sign up for a STACK account and have a secure wallet automatically created for me,
**so that** I can start my investment journey without understanding complex crypto concepts.

### Background
Following the completion of the project scaffolding (Story 1.1), smart contract deployment (Story 1.2), and database schema initialization (Story 1.2a), we now need to implement the user authentication and wallet creation system. This story establishes the foundation for user onboarding by providing a seamless sign-up experience that automatically creates both a user account and a secure in-app wallet using Thirdweb's authentication and wallet management capabilities.

### Business Value
- Enables user onboarding and account creation
- Provides secure wallet management without exposing users to crypto complexity
- Establishes the authentication foundation for all subsequent features
- Creates the user data foundation needed for portfolio tracking and gamification

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: User Sign-Up Implementation
- [ ] A user can sign up for an account using a simple method (e.g., social login or email/password)
- [ ] User registration creates a new User record in the database with all required fields
- [ ] Input validation ensures email uniqueness and proper data formatting
- [ ] Error handling provides clear feedback for registration failures

### AC2: Automatic Wallet Creation
- [ ] Upon sign-up, a new, secure in-app wallet is generated and associated with their user account using the Thirdweb SDK
- [ ] The wallet address is stored in the User model's walletAddress field
- [ ] Wallet creation is atomic with user creation (both succeed or both fail)
- [ ] Wallet private keys are managed securely by Thirdweb (never exposed to our backend)

### AC3: User Authentication & Session Management
- [ ] The user is successfully authenticated, and a session token is returned to the client
- [ ] Session tokens are secure and have appropriate expiration times
- [ ] Authentication state is properly managed on both frontend and backend
- [ ] Users can log out and invalidate their session

### AC4: Secure Data Handling
- [ ] The user's new wallet address is securely stored and is not exposed to the client unless necessary
- [ ] All sensitive user data follows security best practices
- [ ] API endpoints have proper input validation using Zod schemas
- [ ] Error responses don't expose sensitive information

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.2a: The complete database schema is now available with the User model properly configured including the walletAddress field. The Prisma client is set up and ready for user data operations. All database relationships are established for future features.

### Technology Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
**Authentication & Blockchain:**
- Thirdweb Auth (Latest) for user authentication and wallet management
- Thirdweb SDK (Latest) for all blockchain interactions and in-app wallet creation
- TypeScript 5.4+ as primary language for consistency across monorepo

**Backend Framework:**
- Express.js 4.18+ for API framework in serverless functions
- Prisma 5.10+ for type-safe database operations
- Zod for input validation on all API routes

**Frontend Framework:**
- Expo (React Native) SDK 51+ for mobile app development
- Zustand 4.5+ for global state management
- NativeWind 4.0+ for styling

### Data Models Integration
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
**User Model Structure:**
```prisma
model User {
  id              String    @id @default(cuid())
  email           String?   @unique
  walletAddress   String    @unique
  displayName     String
  avatarUrl       String?
  bio             String?
  isCurator       Boolean   @default(false)
  createdAt       DateTime  @default(now())
  updatedAt       DateTime  @updatedAt
  // Related models will be populated in future stories
  portfolio       Portfolio?
  virtualCard     VirtualCard?
  // ... other relationships
}
```

**Key Requirements:**
- walletAddress must be unique and populated during registration
- email is optional but must be unique if provided
- displayName is required for user identification
- All timestamps are automatically managed by Prisma

### Project Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
**File Locations:**

- Implement proper error handling that doesn't expose sensitive information

**Frontend Standards:**
- Use Zustand for global authentication state
- Implement WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance for accessibility
- Provide immediate feedback for all user actions within 100ms
- Use engaging, Gen Z-friendly terminology

**Backend Standards:**
- Use consistent error response format

### External API Integration
[Source: architecture/external-apis.md]
**Thirdweb SDK & APIs:**
- Use Thirdweb SDK for all blockchain interactions and wallet management
- Implement Thirdweb Auth for user authentication and session management

### Technical Constraints
**Authentication Requirements:**
- Must use Thirdweb Auth for Web3-native authentication
- Session tokens must be secure with appropriate expiration
- Wallet private keys must never be exposed to backend or frontend
