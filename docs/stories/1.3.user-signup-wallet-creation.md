# Story 1.3: User Sign-Up and Wallet Creation

## Status
**Current Status:** Ready for Review
**Assigned To:** Dev Agent
**Sprint:** Epic 1 - Foundation & User Onboarding
**Story Points:** 5
**Priority:** High

## Story
**As a** new user,
**I want** to easily sign up for a STACK account with email and password and have a secure wallet automatically created for me,
**so that** I can start my investment journey without understanding complex crypto concepts.

### Background
Following the completion of the project scaffolding (Story 1.1), smart contract deployment (Story 1.2), and database schema initialization (Story 1.2a), we now need to implement the user authentication and wallet creation system. This story establishes the foundation for user onboarding by providing a seamless sign-up experience that automatically creates both a user account and a secure in-app wallet using email/password authentication and Thirdweb Engine API for server-side wallet creation.

### Business Value
- Enables user onboarding with familiar email/password authentication
- Provides secure wallet management without exposing users to crypto complexity
- Establishes the authentication foundation for all subsequent features
- Creates the user data foundation needed for portfolio tracking and gamification
- Implements email verification for enhanced security

    "label": "user-{userId}",
    "createdAt": "2025-01-20T10:30:00Z",
    "smartAccountAddress": "0xeb0effdfb4dc5b3d5d3ac6ce29f3ed213e95d675"
  }
}
```

### Technology Stack
- **Backend:** Express.js, Prisma, Zod, bcrypt, jsonwebtoken
- **Wallet Creation:** Thirdweb Engine API
- **Email Service:** SendGrid or similar
- **Frontend:** Existing React Native components with Zustand store

## Implementation Notes

### Registration Data Requirements
The user registration form must collect the following data:
- **Required Fields:**
  - Email address (unique, used for authentication)
  - Password (minimum 8 characters, hashed with bcrypt)
  - Phone number (with country code)
  - Nationality (country selection)
- **Optional Fields:**
  - Referral code (for tracking user acquisition)

### Frontend Components (Already Built)
The following UI components are already implemented and ready for backend integration:
- `SignupForm.tsx` - Complete registration form with validation for all required fields
- `login.tsx` - Login screen with navigation
- `register.tsx` - Registration screen wrapper
- Auth store with Zustand for state management

### Thirdweb Engine Integration
- **Wallet Creation:** Each user gets a unique server-side wallet created via Thirdweb Engine
- **Wallet Labeling:** Use format `user-{userId}` for consistent wallet identification
- **Security:** Private keys are managed entirely by Thirdweb Engine (never exposed to our backend)
- **Smart Accounts:** Engine provides both EOA address and smart account address
- **Idempotency:** If a wallet with the same label exists, Engine returns the existing wallet

### Security Considerations
- Use bcrypt with salt rounds of 12 for password hashing
- JWT tokens should expire after 24 hours
- Email verification tokens should expire after 24 hours
- Implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- Validate all inputs using Zod schemas
- Never expose Thirdweb Engine credentials to frontend

### Error Handling
- Provide clear, user-friendly error messages
- Log detailed errors server-side for debugging
- Don't expose sensitive information in error responses
- Handle network failures gracefully in frontend

## Testing Strategy

### Backend Tests
- Unit tests for authentication service methods
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Security tests for password hashing and JWT validation
- Email service tests with mock email provider

### Frontend Tests
- Component tests for auth flow integration
- Store tests for authentication state management
- E2E tests for complete registration and login flows

### Test Cases
- Valid user registration and email verification
- Invalid input validation and error handling
- Email verification token expiration
- Password reset flow
- Wallet creation success and failure scenarios
- Authentication state persistence

## Definition of Done
- [x] All acceptance criteria are met and tested
- [x] Backend API endpoints are implemented and documented
- [x] Email verification system is working
- [x] Wallet creation is integrated with Thirdweb Engine
- [x] Frontend components are connected to backend
- [x] All tests are passing
- [x] Security review is completed
- [x] Code is reviewed and merged
