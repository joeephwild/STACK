# Story 1.1: Project Scaffolding & Core Dependencies

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** Developer,
**I want** a clean monorepo structure with all core dependencies and tooling installed,
**so that** I can begin building features in a consistent and secure environment.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A monorepo is initialized with packages for contracts, backend-api, and mobile-app.
2. Core dependencies for React Native, Etherlink integration using the **Thirdweb SDK**, and the Serverless backend are installed and configured.
3. Linters, formatters (e.g., ESLint, Prettier), and testing frameworks (e.g., Jest) are configured at the root level.
4. A basic "hello world" test passes in each package, proving the setup is correct.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This is the first story in the project, so no previous story context exists.

### Project Structure
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
The monorepo must follow the Turborepo structure with:
- `apps/` directory containing mobile-app and backend-api
- `packages/` directory containing contracts, shared-types, ui-library, eslint-config
- Root-level package.json and turbo.json for workspace management

### Technology Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
**Frontend (Mobile App):**
- TypeScript 5.4+ as primary language
- Expo (React Native) SDK 51+ as core framework
- NativeWind 4.0+ for utility-first CSS styling
- Zustand 4.5+ for global state management
- Thirdweb SDK for blockchain interactions

**Backend (API):**
- TypeScript 5.4+ as primary language
- Express.js 4.18+ as API framework
- Prisma 5.10+ as ORM for PostgreSQL database
- Thirdweb Auth for authentication and wallet management
- Zod for input validation (critical requirement)

**Development Tools:**
- Jest 29.7+ for unit testing
- React Native Testing Library for component testing
- Supertest for API testing
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- Sentry for error tracking
- AWS CDK 2.140+ for infrastructure (setup only, not deployment)

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- Mobile app: `apps/mobile-app/`
- Backend API: `apps/backend-api/`
- Smart contracts: `packages/contracts/`
- Shared types: `packages/shared-types/`
- UI library: `packages/ui-library/`
- ESLint config: `packages/eslint-config/`

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
**Critical Rules:**
- NEVER commit secret keys or environment variables to repository
- All API routes must have input validation using Zod
- All frontend components must be styled using NativeWind classes
- Shared types must be defined in packages/shared-types and imported from there

**Naming Conventions:**
- Components: PascalCase.tsx (e.g., UserProfile.tsx)
- Hooks: useCamelCase.ts (e.g., useAuth.ts)
- API Files: camelCase.ts (e.g., getBaskets.ts)
- Services: camelCaseService.ts (e.g., portfolioService.ts)

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
**Test Organization:**
- Frontend unit/component tests: Co-located with component files (*.test.tsx)
- Frontend E2E tests: Dedicated e2e/ folder in mobile-app
- Backend unit tests: Co-located with service files (*.test.ts)
- Backend integration tests: Dedicated __tests__/ folder in backend-api
- Smart contract tests: Within contracts package using standard tools

**Required Test Examples:**
- Frontend: Jest & React Native Testing Library for component testing
- Backend: Jest & Supertest for API testing
- E2E: Playwright for end-to-end scenarios (setup only for this story)

**Testing Pyramid Strategy:**
- Many fast unit tests at the base
- Healthy number of integration tests in the middle
- Few high-value end-to-end tests at the top

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Must use specified versions for all dependencies
- PostgreSQL 15+ required for database compatibility
- All packages must be compatible with Turborepo build system
- TypeScript must be consistently configured across all packages

## Testing
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
**Test File Locations:**
- Mobile app component tests: Co-located with components (*.test.tsx)
- Backend API tests: Co-located with services (*.test.ts)
- Smart contract tests: Within packages/contracts following standard practices

**Testing Frameworks:**
- Jest 29.7+ for all unit testing
- React Native Testing Library for mobile component testing
- Supertest for backend API testing
- Foundry or Hardhat for smart contract testing

**Testing Requirements for This Story:**
- Create basic "hello world" test in each package
- Verify test runner configuration works across monorepo
- Ensure all tests pass with turbo test command
- Test files must follow naming conventions (*.test.ts/tsx)
