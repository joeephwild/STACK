# Story 1.2: Basic Smart Contract for Asset Ownership

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** Developer,
**I want** a basic smart contract deployed on the Etherlink testnet that can track fractional ownership of assets,
**so that** we have a foundational on-chain component to build upon.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A simple smart contract (e.g., following ERC-1155 standard) is created in the contracts package.
2. The contract includes functions for a trusted admin to mint fractional tokens representing ownership to a user's wallet address.
3. The contract is deployed to an Etherlink testnet **using the Thirdweb platform/CLI**.
4. The ownership balance of any fractional asset for any wallet address can be queried from the contract **via the Thirdweb SDK**.

## Tasks / Subtasks

  - [x] Create StackToken.sol contract file in packages/contracts/contract/

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1: The monorepo structure is established with packages/contracts directory ready for smart contract development. All development tooling (TypeScript, testing frameworks) is configured and working.

### Technology Stack Requirements
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
**Blockchain Integration:**
- Thirdweb SDK (Latest) for all blockchain interactions and smart contract deployment
- Thirdweb Auth (Latest) for user authentication and wallet management
- TypeScript 5.4+ as primary language for consistency across monorepo

**Smart Contract Development:**
- Must use Thirdweb platform/CLI for deployment to Etherlink testnet
- Contract must be compatible with Thirdweb SDK for seamless integration
- Follow ERC-1155 standard for multi-token fractional ownership

### Project Structure Requirements
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
**File Locations:**
- Smart contracts: `packages/contracts/`
- Contract files should be in `packages/contracts/contract/`
- Tests should follow standard practices within contracts package
- Shared types: `packages/shared-types/` (for contract interfaces)

### Data Models Integration
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]
**Database Integration:**
- User model includes `walletAddress` field (String @unique) for linking to smart contract
- Portfolio and PortfolioHolding models track off-chain investment data
- Smart contract will handle on-chain fractional ownership verification
- Basket model includes `assets` field (Json) for asset composition data

**Key Relationships:**
- Each User has a unique walletAddress that corresponds to their smart contract wallet
- PortfolioHolding tracks `unitsOwned` which should correspond to smart contract token balances
- Smart contract serves as source of truth for actual ownership verification

### Coding Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
**Critical Rules:**
- NEVER commit secret keys or environment variables to repository
- Shared types must be defined in packages/shared-types and imported from there
- Follow TypeScript naming conventions for consistency

**Smart Contract Specific:**
- Contract files should use Solidity naming conventions
- Interface definitions should be created in packages/shared-types for TypeScript integration

### External API Integration
[Source: architecture/external-apis.md]
**Thirdweb SDK & APIs:**
- Use Thirdweb SDK for all blockchain interactions
- Deploy using Thirdweb platform/CLI tools
- Ensure contract is compatible with Thirdweb's infrastructure

### Technical Constraints
**Smart Contract Requirements:**
- Must implement ERC-1155 standard for multi-token support
- Must include admin role for controlled minting
- Must be deployable via Thirdweb platform
- Must be queryable via Thirdweb SDK
- Must support fractional ownership representation

**Security Considerations:**
- Implement proper access control for admin functions
- Use OpenZeppelin contracts for security best practices
- Validate all inputs to prevent common vulnerabilities
- Emit proper events for transparency and monitoring

## Testing
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Test File Locations:**
- Smart contract tests: Within packages/contracts following standard practices
- Tests should use Foundry or Hardhat as mentioned in testing strategy
- Integration tests with Thirdweb SDK should verify end-to-end functionality

**Testing Requirements for This Story:**
- Unit tests for all contract functions (minting, balance queries, access control)
- Integration tests with Thirdweb SDK to verify deployment and query functionality
- Test admin role functionality and access restrictions
- Test ERC-1155 compliance and multi-token behavior
- Verify proper event emission and error handling

**Testing Frameworks:**
- Use standard smart contract testing tools (Foundry or Hardhat)
- Ensure tests can run as part of monorepo test suite
- Follow testing pyramid: many unit tests, fewer integration tests
