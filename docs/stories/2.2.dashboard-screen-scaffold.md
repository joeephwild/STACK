# Story 2.2: Create Dashboard Screen Scaffold

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** Developer,
**I want** a basic scaffold for the Dashboard screen,
**so that** we have a foundational component to build the "For You" feed and portfolio summary upon.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Dashboard Component Creation**: A `DashboardScreen` component is created and linked to the Dashboard tab
2. **Screen Title Display**: The screen displays a static title, "Dashboard / For You"

## Dev Notes

### Project Structure Information

Based on the unified project structure, the dashboard screen should be organized as follows:
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

```
apps/mobile-app/
├── app/(tabs)/
│   ├── dashboard.tsx        # New Dashboard screen
│   └── _layout.tsx         # Tab navigation (already updated in Story 2.1)
```

### Current Implementation Context

[Source: Story 2.1 implementation]

- **Tab Navigation**: Main tab bar navigation is implemented with 5 tabs
- **Dashboard Tab**: Already configured in tab layout, needs screen implementation
- **Navigation System**: Expo Router file-based routing is active
- **Design System**: NativeWind styling system is configured and ready

### Design System Requirements

[Source: docs/design.json]

**Dashboard Screen Specifications:**

- **Background**: Dark theme (#000000)
- **Primary Text**: White (#FFFFFF)
- **Secondary Text**: Light gray for subtitles
- **Card Background**: Neutral Light (#EAE2FF) for content sections
- **Typography**:
  - Title: MD Nichrome H2 (24px, bold)
  - Section Headers: MD Nichrome H3 (18px, bold)
  - Body Text: Gilroy (16px, regular)

**Layout Structure:**

```
Dashboard Screen
├── Header Section
│   ├── Title: "Dashboard"
│   └── Optional: User greeting or notification icon
├── Portfolio Summary Section
│   ├── Total Portfolio Value (placeholder)
│   ├── Today's Change (placeholder)
│   └── Quick Action Button (placeholder)
└── Feed Items Section
    ├── Section Title: "For You"
    ├── Feed Item 1 (placeholder)
    ├── Feed Item 2 (placeholder)
    └── Load More indicator (placeholder)
```

### Component Architecture Requirements

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md, architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Screen Component Structure:**

- **Framework**: React Native with TypeScript
- **Navigation**: Expo Router screen component
- **Styling**: NativeWind utility classes only
- **State Management**: Local state for screen-specific data, Zustand for global state
- **Component Organization**: Follow atomic design principles

**Code Standards:**

- **File Structure**: Single screen component per file
- **TypeScript**: Strict typing for all props and state
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic structure
- **Performance**: Optimize for smooth scrolling and rendering

### Placeholder Content Specifications

[Source: Epic 3 and 4 context from epic-details.md]

**Portfolio Summary Placeholder:**

- **Total Value**: Display mock portfolio value (e.g., "$1,234.56")
- **Change Indicator**: Show mock daily change (e.g., "+$12.34 (+1.2%)")
- **Visual Elements**: Use accent color (#B9FF4B) for positive changes
- **Action Button**: "View Full Portfolio" button linking to portfolio tab

**Feed Items Placeholder:**

- **Item Types**: Mix of investment opportunities, quest suggestions, and tips
- **Item Structure**: Title, description, action button, and optional image
- **Content Examples**:
  - "New Basket Available: Tech Innovators"
  - "Complete Your First Quest: Set Up Round-ups"
  - "AI Tip: Market Update on Your Holdings"
- **Visual Design**: Card-based layout with consistent spacing

### Technical Implementation Details

[Source: architecture/components.md, previous story context]

**Screen Component Pattern:**

```typescript
// app/(tabs)/dashboard.tsx
import { View, Text, ScrollView } from 'react-native';
import { SafeAreaView } from 'react-native-safe-area-context';

export default function DashboardScreen() {
  return (
    <SafeAreaView className="flex-1 bg-black">
      <ScrollView className="flex-1 px-4">
        {/* Screen content */}
      </ScrollView>
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
}
```

**Component Integration:**

- **UI Library**: Use components from packages/ui-library where available
- **Shared Components**: Leverage existing Button, Typography, and Container components
- **Icon System**: Use consistent icon library (Expo Vector Icons)
- **Navigation**: Integrate with existing tab navigation system

### Future Integration Preparation

[Source: Epic 3 and 4 story context]

**Placeholder Preparation for Future Stories:**

- **Portfolio Summary**: Will be populated by Epic 3 portfolio data
- **Feed Algorithm**: Will be implemented in Story 4.4 ("For You" Algorithmic Feed)
- **Investment Actions**: Will connect to Epic 3 basket investment flows
- **Quest Integration**: Will link to Epic 4 gamification features

**Data Structure Preparation:**

- **Mock Data**: Use realistic placeholder data that matches expected API responses
- **Component Props**: Design component interfaces to accept real data in future iterations
- **State Management**: Prepare Zustand store structure for dashboard data

### Testing Standards

[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Unit Tests Required:**

- **Test Location**: `app/(tabs)/__tests__/dashboard.test.tsx`
- **Test Coverage**: Component rendering, navigation integration, accessibility
- **Mock Data**: Use consistent mock data for placeholder content
- **Accessibility Testing**: Screen reader compatibility and focus management

**Testing Frameworks:**

- **Jest + React Native Testing Library** for component testing
- **@testing-library/jest-native** for accessibility assertions
- **React Navigation Testing** for navigation behavior

**Test Cases:**

```typescript
describe('DashboardScreen', () => {
  it('renders screen title correctly');
  it('displays portfolio summary placeholder');
  it('displays feed items placeholder');
  it('handles navigation properly');
  it('meets accessibility requirements');
  it('responds to different screen sizes');
});
```

### Performance Considerations

[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Optimization Requirements:**

- **Lazy Loading**: Prepare for future lazy loading of feed content
- **Scroll Performance**: Optimize ScrollView for smooth performance
- **Memory Management**: Efficient component mounting and unmounting
- **Image Handling**: Prepare for future image optimization in feed items

**Monitoring:**

- **Render Performance**: Track component render times
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor memory consumption during scrolling
- **Navigation Speed**: Ensure fast tab switching performance

## Testing

### Unit Tests

- **Location**: `app/(tabs)/__tests__/dashboard.test.tsx`
- **Framework**: Jest + React Native Testing Library
- **Coverage**: Screen rendering, placeholder content, navigation integration

### Integration Tests

- **Navigation**: Test tab navigation to dashboard screen
- **Layout**: Verify responsive layout across device sizes
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader and keyboard navigation testing

### Visual Tests

- **Design Compliance**: Validate against design.json specifications
- **Placeholder Content**: Verify placeholder sections display correctly
- **Responsive Design**: Test layout adaptation across screen sizes
