# Story 2.4: Create Card Hub Screen Scaffold

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** Developer,
**I want** a basic scaffold for the Card Hub screen,
**so that** we can later add the virtual card details, transaction history, and settings.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A `CardHubScreen` component is created and linked to the Card tab.
2. The screen displays a static title, "Card & Spending".
3. The screen includes placeholder elements for the "Virtual Card", "Spendable Balance", and "Recent Transactions".
4. The component follows the established design system specifications from design.json.
5. The screen integrates properly with Expo Router navigation from Story 2.1.
6. The component is accessible and meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards.
7. The screen layout is responsive and works across different device sizes.
8. Placeholder content uses realistic mock data that matches expected future API responses.

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Information
- **File Location**: `apps/mobile-app/app/(tabs)/card.tsx`
- **Navigation Integration**: Builds on Story 2.1 tab navigation implementation
- **Component Structure**: Follows atomic design methodology established in Story 1.4
- **Styling System**: Uses NativeWind with design system tokens from `design.json`
- **State Management**: Prepared for future Zustand integration for card and transaction data

### Design System Specifications
- **Colors**: 
  - Dark theme: #000000 (text), #FFFFFF (backgrounds)
  - Accent: #5852FF (primary brand color)
  - Card gradient: Linear gradient for virtual card design
- **Typography**: 
  - Headings: MD Nichrome font family
  - Body text: Gilroy font family
  - Title: 24px, bold weight
  - Card text: 16px, medium weight
  - Transaction text: 14px, regular weight
- **Spacing**: Follow 8px grid system
- **Layout**: Vertical stack with proper padding and margins
- **Card Dimensions**: Standard credit card aspect ratio (1.586:1)

### Mock Data Structure
```typescript
// Spendable Balance placeholder
spendableBalance: "$2,456.78"
change: "+$123.45 this week"

// Virtual Card placeholder
virtualCard: {
  lastFour: "4321",
  expiryDate: "12/28",
  cardholderName: "STACK USER"
}

// Recent Transactions placeholder
transactions: [
  { merchant: "Coffee Shop", amount: "-$4.50", date: "Today", category: "Food" },
  { merchant: "Gas Station", amount: "-$35.00", date: "Yesterday", category: "Transport" },
  { merchant: "Grocery Store", amount: "-$67.89", date: "Dec 17", category: "Food" },
  { merchant: "Round-up Investment", amount: "-$2.39", date: "Dec 17", category: "Investment" }
]
```

### Future Integration Points
- **Epic 4**: Will integrate with round-up investing and automated transactions
- **Epic 5**: Will connect to portfolio-backed loan functionality
- **Component Reusability**: Card and transaction components will be reused across the app

### Testing Standards
- **Test File Location**: `apps/mobile-app/__tests__/screens/card.test.tsx`
- **Testing Framework**: Jest with React Native Testing Library
- **Test Coverage Requirements**: Minimum 80% coverage for component logic
- **Test Categories**:
  - Component rendering and structure
  - Navigation integration
  - Accessibility compliance
  - Responsive behavior
  - Mock data display

### Testing Patterns
```typescript
// Example test structure
describe('CardHubScreen', () => {
  it('renders card hub title correctly', () => {});
  it('displays virtual card placeholder', () => {});
  it('shows spendable balance', () => {});
  it('renders recent transactions list', () => {});
  it('navigates correctly from tab bar', () => {});
  it('meets accessibility standards', () => {});
});
```
