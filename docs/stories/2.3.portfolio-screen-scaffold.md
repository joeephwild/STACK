# Story 2.3: Create Portfolio Screen Scaffold

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** Developer,
**I want** a basic scaffold for the Portfolio screen,
**so that** we can later populate it with the user's detailed holdings.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A `PortfolioScreen` component is created and linked to the Portfolio tab.
2. The screen displays a static title, "My Portfolio".
3. The screen includes a placeholder for the "Total Value" and a "Holdings List".
4. The component follows the established design system specifications from design.json.
5. The screen integrates properly with Expo Router navigation from Story 2.1.
6. The component is accessible and meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards.
7. The screen layout is responsive and works across different device sizes.
8. Placeholder content uses realistic mock data that matches expected future API responses.

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Information
- **File Location**: `apps/mobile-app/app/(tabs)/portfolio.tsx`
- **Navigation Integration**: Builds on Story 2.1 tab navigation implementation
- **Component Structure**: Follows atomic design methodology established in Story 1.4
- **Styling System**: Uses NativeWind with design system tokens from `design.json`
- **State Management**: Prepared for future Zustand integration for portfolio data

### Design System Specifications
- **Colors**:
  - Dark theme: #000000 (text), #FFFFFF (backgrounds)
  - Accent: #5852FF (primary brand color)
- **Typography**:
  - Headings: MD Nichrome font family
  - Body text: Gilroy font family
  - Title: 24px, bold weight
  - Placeholder text: 16px, regular weight
- **Spacing**: Follow 8px grid system
- **Layout**: Vertical stack with proper padding and margins

### Mock Data Structure
```typescript
// Total Value placeholder
totalValue: "$1,234.56"
change: "+$45.67 (+3.8%)"

// Holdings List placeholder
holdings: [
  { name: "Tech Innovators Basket", value: "$567.89", change: "+2.1%" },
  { name: "Green Energy Basket", value: "$345.67", change: "+1.5%" },
  { name: "Starter Slice", value: "$321.00", change: "+0.8%" }
]
```

### Future Integration Points
- **Epic 3**: Will integrate with real portfolio data from backend API
- **Epic 4**: Will add gamification elements and performance tracking
- **Component Reusability**: Portfolio value and holdings components will be reused in Dashboard screen

### Testing Standards
- **Test File Location**: `apps/mobile-app/__tests__/screens/portfolio.test.tsx`
- **Testing Framework**: Jest with React Native Testing Library
- **Test Coverage Requirements**: Minimum 80% coverage for component logic
- **Test Categories**:
  - Component rendering and structure
  - Navigation integration
  - Accessibility compliance
  - Responsive behavior
  - Mock data display

### Testing Patterns
```typescript
// Example test structure
describe('PortfolioScreen', () => {
  it('renders portfolio title correctly', () => {});
  it('displays total value placeholder', () => {});
  it('renders holdings list with mock data', () => {});
  it('navigates correctly from tab bar', () => {});
  it('meets accessibility standards', () => {});
});
```
