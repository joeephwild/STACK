# Story 1.5: Onboarding Flow & Free Starter Slice

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** new user who has just signed up for STACK,
**I want** to go through a guided onboarding flow that introduces me to the platform and gives me a free starter investment,
**so that** I can understand how STACK works and start investing immediately without any initial financial commitment.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Multi-step onboarding flow**: Create a 3-step onboarding flow that guides new users through STACK's core concepts
2. **Welcome step**: Display welcome message with engaging illustration and "Get Started" button
3. **Free starter slice step**: Inform users about their free starter investment with celebratory messaging
4. **How it works step**: Explain core concepts (Baskets, Power Up, Quests) with feature cards and illustrations
5. **Automatic wallet creation**: Seamlessly create a Web3 wallet for the user during onboarding without requiring manual setup
6. **Free starter investment**: Automatically allocate a small investment (e.g., $5-10) to a beginner-friendly basket
7. **Smooth navigation**: Allow users to navigate between steps with clear progress indication
8. **Skip functionality**: Allow users to skip onboarding if they prefer to explore on their own
9. **Completion redirect**: After onboarding, redirect users to the main dashboard with their new investment visible
10. **Mobile-optimized**: Ensure the flow works perfectly on mobile devices with proper touch targets and responsive design
11. **Accessibility compliance**: Meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards with proper screen reader support
12. **Design system compliance**: Use exact colors, typography, and component specifications from design.json
