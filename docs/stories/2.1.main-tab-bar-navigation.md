# Story 2.1: Implement Main Tab Bar Navigation

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** mobile app user,
**I want** to navigate between the main sections of the app using a bottom tab bar,
**so that** I can easily access Dashboard, Portfolio, Card, Quests, and Profile features with intuitive navigation.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Tab Bar Structure**: Implement bottom tab bar with exactly 5 tabs in the following order: Dashboard, Portfolio, Card, Quests, Profile
2. **Visual Design Compliance**: Tab bar must match design.json specifications including colors (#5852FF active, #6B7280 inactive), typography, and spacing
3. **Navigation Integration**: Each tab must navigate to its corresponding screen using Expo Router
4. **Active State Management**: Active tab must be visually distinct with proper color and icon states
5. **Accessibility Support**: Tab bar must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards with proper labels and focus management
6. **Responsive Design**: Tab bar must work consistently across different device sizes and orientations
7. **Icon Integration**: Each tab must display appropriate icons that match the design system
8. **Persistent Navigation**: Tab bar must remain visible and functional across all main app screens

## Dev Notes

### Project Structure Information
Based on the unified project structure, tab navigation should be organized as follows:
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

```
apps/mobile-app/
├── app/(tabs)/
│   ├── _layout.tsx          # Main tab configuration
│   ├── index.tsx            # Profile tab (existing)
│   ├── dashboard.tsx        # New Dashboard tab
│   ├── portfolio.tsx        # New Portfolio tab
│   ├── card.tsx            # New Card tab
│   └── quests.tsx          # New Quests tab
```

### Current Implementation Status
[Source: Current codebase analysis]

- **Existing**: Basic tab layout with 2 tabs (Profile, Explore)
- **Current Colors**: Already using correct active color (#5852FF)
- **TabBarIcon Component**: Exists and needs extension for new icons
- **Expo Router**: Already configured and working

### Design System Requirements
[Source: docs/design.json]

**Navigation Component Specifications:**
- **Background**: Dark theme (#000000)
- **Active Tab Color**: #5852FF (Primary)
- **Inactive Tab Color**: #6B7280 (Gray)
- **Tab Height**: 80px minimum for accessibility
- **Icon Size**: 24x24px
- **Typography**: Gilroy font family for tab labels
- **Border**: Top border with subtle divider

**Required Tab Configuration:**
1. **Dashboard**: Home/overview icon, route: `/dashboard`
2. **Portfolio**: Chart/graph icon, route: `/portfolio`
3. **Card**: Credit card icon, route: `/card`
4. **Quests**: Trophy/star icon, route: `/quests`
5. **Profile**: User/person icon, route: `/` (existing index)

### Technical Implementation Details
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md, architecture/coding-standards.md]

**Navigation Framework:**
- **Expo Router**: Use file-based routing with (tabs) group
- **Tab Component**: Expo Router Tabs component
- **Styling**: NativeWind classes for consistent theming
- **State Management**: Zustand for any navigation state if needed

**Component Architecture:**
- **TabBarIcon Component**: Extend existing component for new icon types
- **Screen Components**: Create placeholder screens with proper TypeScript interfaces
- **Accessibility**: Use Expo Router's built-in accessibility features

**Code Standards:**
- **TypeScript**: Strict typing for all navigation props and screen components
- **NativeWind**: Use utility classes, no inline styles
- **Component Structure**: Follow atomic design principles
- **File Naming**: Use kebab-case for screen files

### Icon Requirements
[Source: design.json component specifications]

Each tab requires specific icons that match the design system:
- **Dashboard**: Home or grid icon representing overview
- **Portfolio**: Line chart or pie chart icon for investments
- **Card**: Credit card or wallet icon for card features
- **Quests**: Trophy, star, or target icon for gamification
- **Profile**: User or person icon for account settings

Icons should be implemented using:
- **Vector Icons**: Expo Vector Icons or custom SVG components
- **Size**: 24x24px standard size
- **Color**: Inherit from tab active/inactive states
- **Accessibility**: Proper icon descriptions for screen readers

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Unit Tests Required:**
- Test file location: `app/(tabs)/__tests__/`
- Test navigation between all tabs
- Test active/inactive state changes
- Test accessibility labels and focus management
- Test icon rendering for all states

**Testing Frameworks:**
- **Jest + React Native Testing Library** for component testing
- **@testing-library/jest-native** for accessibility testing
- **React Navigation Testing** for navigation behavior

**Test Coverage Requirements:**
- All tab navigation functionality
- Active/inactive state management
- Accessibility compliance
- Icon rendering and state changes
- Screen mounting and unmounting

### Integration Notes
[Source: Previous stories context]

**Dependencies from Previous Stories:**
- **Story 1.4**: UI component library is available for consistent styling
- **Story 1.5**: Onboarding flow integration may need navigation updates
- **Authentication**: Tab navigation should respect auth state

**Future Story Preparation:**
- Tab screens created as placeholders will be populated in subsequent Epic 2 stories
- Navigation structure supports future deep linking requirements
- Component architecture allows for easy screen content integration

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- **Location**: `app/(tabs)/__tests__/`
- **Framework**: Jest + React Native Testing Library
- **Coverage**: Tab navigation, state management, accessibility

### Integration Tests
- **Navigation Flow**: Test complete tab switching workflow
- **State Persistence**: Verify navigation state across app lifecycle
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader and keyboard navigation testing

### Visual Tests
- **Design Compliance**: Validate against design.json specifications
- **Responsive**: Test across different device sizes
- **Icon States**: Verify active/inactive icon rendering
