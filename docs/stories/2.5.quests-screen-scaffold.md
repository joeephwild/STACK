# Story 2.5: Create Quests Screen Scaffold

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** Developer,
**I want** a basic scaffold for the Quests screen,
**so that** we can later build the full Battle Pass and quest tracking interface.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A `QuestsScreen` component is created and linked to the Quests tab.
2. The screen displays a static title, "Quests & Rewards".
3. The screen includes placeholders for the "Battle Pass Progress Bar" and an "Active Quests List".
4. The component follows the established design system specifications from design.json.
5. The screen integrates properly with Expo Router navigation from Story 2.1.
6. The component is accessible and meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards.
7. The screen layout is responsive and works across different device sizes.
8. Placeholder content uses realistic mock data that matches expected future API responses.

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Information
- **File Location**: `apps/mobile-app/app/(tabs)/quests.tsx`
- **Navigation Integration**: Builds on Story 2.1 tab navigation implementation
- **Component Structure**: Follows atomic design methodology established in Story 1.4
- **Styling System**: Uses NativeWind with design system tokens from `design.json`
- **State Management**: Prepared for future Zustand integration for quest and progress data

### Design System Specifications
- **Colors**: 
  - Dark theme: #000000 (text), #FFFFFF (backgrounds)
  - Accent: #5852FF (primary brand color)
  - Progress: Gradient colors for progress bars
  - Success: Green tones for completed quests
  - Warning: Orange tones for in-progress quests
- **Typography**: 
  - Headings: MD Nichrome font family
  - Body text: Gilroy font family
  - Title: 24px, bold weight
  - Quest titles: 18px, medium weight
  - Quest descriptions: 14px, regular weight
- **Spacing**: Follow 8px grid system
- **Layout**: Vertical stack with proper padding and margins
- **Progress Bar**: Height 8px with rounded corners

### Mock Data Structure
```typescript
// Battle Pass Progress placeholder
battlePass: {
  currentLevel: 3,
  totalLevels: 10,
  currentXP: 750,
  nextLevelXP: 1000,
  progressPercentage: 75
}

// Active Quests placeholder
quests: [
  {
    id: "quest-1",
    title: "First Investment",
    description: "Power up your first basket",
    progress: 0,
    maxProgress: 1,
    reward: "50 XP + $5 bonus",
    status: "active",
    category: "Getting Started"
  },
  {
    id: "quest-2", 
    title: "Round-up Master",
    description: "Enable round-up investing",
    progress: 1,
    maxProgress: 1,
    reward: "100 XP",
    status: "completed",
    category: "Automation"
  },
  {
    id: "quest-3",
    title: "Diversification Pro",
    description: "Invest in 3 different baskets",
    progress: 1,
    maxProgress: 3,
    reward: "200 XP + Badge",
    status: "in-progress",
    category: "Strategy"
  }
]
```

### Future Integration Points
- **Epic 4**: Will integrate with full gamification system and quest tracking
- **Epic 3**: Will connect to investment actions for quest completion
- **Component Reusability**: Progress and quest components will be reused in dashboard

### Testing Standards
- **Test File Location**: `apps/mobile-app/__tests__/screens/quests.test.tsx`
- **Testing Framework**: Jest with React Native Testing Library
- **Test Coverage Requirements**: Minimum 80% coverage for component logic
- **Test Categories**:
  - Component rendering and structure
  - Navigation integration
  - Accessibility compliance
  - Responsive behavior
  - Mock data display
  - Progress bar functionality

### Testing Patterns
```typescript
// Example test structure
describe('QuestsScreen', () => {
  it('renders quests title correctly', () => {});
  it('displays battle pass progress bar', () => {});
  it('shows active quests list', () => {});
  it('renders quest progress indicators', () => {});
  it('navigates correctly from tab bar', () => {});
  it('meets accessibility standards', () => {});
});
```
