# Story 1.4: Component-First Development Setup

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** Developer,
**I want** to establish a component-first development approach,
**so that** all required UI components are built before constructing complete screens.

### Background
Following the completion of the user sign-up and wallet creation system (Story 1.3), we now need to establish a component-first development approach.

## Technical Notes

### Project Structure
- Components should be organized in `mobile-app/src/components/` with subdirectories for atoms, molecules, and organisms
- Each component should have its own directory with index file, component file, styles, and tests
- Shared types and interfaces should be defined in `mobile-app/src/types/`
- Component exports should be centralized through barrel exports for easy consumption

### Component Architecture
- Use React Native with TypeScript for comprehensive type safety
- Implement components using functional components with hooks
- Follow Atomic Design methodology for component organization:
  - **Atoms**: Button, Input Field, Icon, Toggle Switch, Progress Bar
  - **Molecules**: Card variants, Header, List Items, Form groups
  - **Organisms**: Bottom Tab Bar, Modal, Complex lists, Screen layouts
- Use NativeWind for styling to maintain consistency with design system
- Integrate with Zustand for state management where needed
- Implement proper prop interfaces for all components with comprehensive TypeScript definitions

### Design System Integration
- Components must adhere to design tokens defined in `design.json`
- Implement comprehensive color palette:
  - Primary (#5852FF) for primary actions and highlights
  - Accent (#B9FF4B) for secondary actions and positive indicators
  - Neutral Light (#EAE2FF) for card backgrounds
  - Neutral Dark (#000000) for main app background
  - Text (#FFFFFF) for primary text on dark backgrounds
- Use typography system with proper type scale:
  - MD Nichrome for headings (H1: 36px, H2: 24px, H3: 18px)
  - Gilroy for body text and UI (Body: 16px, Small: 14px)
- Follow 8px grid system for consistent spacing and layout
- Implement dark-mode-first design approach with high contrast
- Ensure minimum 44x44px touch targets for accessibility

### Screen Layout Requirements
Based on design.json specifications, components must support all defined screen layouts:
- **Authentication**: Signup, Login flows with form components
- **Onboarding**: Multi-step onboarding with progress indicators
- **Dashboard**: "For You" feed with personalized content cards
- **Portfolio**: Balance displays, asset lists, basket details
- **Card Hub**: Virtual card display, spendable balance, round-up controls
- **Micro-loan Hub**: Collateral displays, loan forms, active loans
- **Quests**: Battle pass progress, quest lists, reward claiming
- **Profile**: User info, settings sections, logout functionality

### Component State Management
- Implement proper state handling for interactive components
- Support for loading, error, and success states where applicable
- Proper form validation and error messaging
- Accessibility states (focused, disabled, selected)
- Animation states for micro-interactions and feedback

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all components using Jest and React Native Testing Library
- Visual regression tests for component variants and states
- Accessibility testing to ensure WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance
- Performance testing for component rendering and animations
- Integration tests for complex component interactions
- Snapshot testing for component structure consistency

### Performance Considerations
- Optimize component rendering with React.memo where appropriate
- Implement lazy loading for heavy components
- Use efficient list rendering for large datasets
- Maintain 60fps for all animations and interactions
- Optimize image and icon loading with proper caching

## Dev Notes

### Project Structure Information
Based on the unified project structure, components should be organized as follows:
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

```
apps/
├── mobile-app/
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── atoms/           # Basic UI elements
│   │   ├── molecules/       # Component combinations
│   │   └── organisms/       # Complex components
```

Additionally, shared components should be placed in:
```
packages/
├── ui-library/             # Shared UI components
```

### Component Architecture
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

- **Component Structure**: Follow atomic design principles (atoms, molecules, organisms)
- **Styling**: Use **NativeWind** classes exclusively - no inline styles or StyleSheet
- **State Management**: Use **Zustand** for global state, local state for component-specific data

### Frontend Architecture
[Source: architecture/frontend-backend-architecture.md]

The component structure should follow this pattern:
```typescript
// src/components/ui/MyComponent.tsx
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

interface MyComponentProps {
  title: string;
}

export const MyComponent = ({ title }: MyComponentProps) => {
  return (
    <View className="p-4 bg-neutral-light rounded-lg">
      <Text className="text-white font-bold">{title}</Text>
    </View>
  );
};
```

### Design System Compliance
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

- **MANDATORY**: Always reference `/docs/design.json` when building any UI components or screens
- **Color Palette**: Use only the colors defined in `design.json` - never hardcode colors
- **Typography**: Follow the exact font specifications (MD Nichrome for headings, Gilroy for body text)
- **Component Styling**: Match the component specifications exactly as defined in the design system

### UI Components from Design
[Source: docs/design.json]

The following core components have been identified from design.json:

1. **Buttons**:
   - Primary (royalBlue background)
   - Accent (limeGreen background)
   - Tertiary (transparent with border)

2. **Cards**:
   - Default card
   - Quest card

3. **Navigation**:
   - Bottom navigation bar with 5 tabs

4. **Form Elements**:
   - Input fields
   - Social login buttons

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]

Component tests should be co-located with the component files:

```typescript
// src/components/ui/Button.test.tsx
import { render, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react-native';
import { Button } from './Button';

it('calls onPress when tapped', () => {
  const onPressMock = jest.fn();
  const { getByText } = render(<Button title="Test" onPress={onPressMock} />);

  fireEvent.press(getByText('Test'));

  expect(onPressMock).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
});
```
