# **User Interface Design Goals**

## **Overall UX Vision**

The user experience will feel less like a traditional finance app and more like a modern social or gaming application. The vision is to create an interface that is visually engaging, builds confidence through radical clarity, and feels empowering. Every interaction should be simple, provide immediate feedback, and reinforce our core principles of hope, identity, and participation.

## **Key Interaction Paradigms**

* **Gamified Actions:** Core investment actions ("Power Up") will be treated as rewarding moments with satisfying visual and haptic feedback.
* **Personalized Discovery:** The primary method for discovering new investment opportunities will be through a "For You" algorithmic feed, not complex search tools or screeners.
* **Social & Identity Driven:** The interface will prominently feature "Community Curators" and allow users to visually showcase their portfolio as a "social badge" of their identity.
* **Automated & Passive:** Key features like "Round-ups" and "Payday Investing" will be "set and forget," with a simple and clear interface for managing these automations.

## **Core Screens and Views**

This is a conceptual list of the primary areas needed to fulfill the product's requirements:

* **Onboarding:** A guided setup that introduces the "free starter slice" and core concepts.
* **Dashboard / "For You" Feed:** The main screen for discovery and a simple overview of the user's portfolio.
* **Basket Detail View:** An exploratory screen to see the contents and philosophy behind a curated "Basket."
* **Quest / Battle Pass Screen:** A dedicated area to track gamified progress, streaks, and claim rewards.
* **Card & Spending Hub:** A screen to manage the virtual debit card, view transactions, and configure the "Round-up" feature.
* **Micro-loan Hub:** A simple interface to manage portfolio collateral and loan status.
* **AI Expert Interface:** A conversational or integrated UI to interact with the AI for personalized tips and education.

## **Accessibility**

* **Standard:** WCAG AA

## **Branding**

* **Status:** To be defined. A visual identity needs to be established that resonates with Gen Zâ€”likely modern, clean, dark-mode friendly, and potentially with customizable themes or elements (like the card skins).

## **Target Device and Platforms**

* **Platform:** Native Mobile App (iOS & Android)
