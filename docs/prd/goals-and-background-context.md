# **Goals and Background Context**

## **Goals**

* To make investing accessible and simple for Gen Z by removing traditional jargon and high capital requirements.
* To create an engaging and habit-forming experience by integrating gamification and community-driven social features.
* To automate the investment process by seamlessly linking it to users' daily spending and income habits.
* To empower users with immediate liquidity and real-world utility for their digital assets.
* To provide personalized, AI-driven guidance that builds user confidence and financial literacy.

## **Background Context**

Gen Z represents a digitally-native generation that is largely underserved by traditional financial platforms. They often find the world of investing to be complex, intimidating, and misaligned with their social and community-driven values, creating a significant barrier to early wealth creation.

STACK addresses this gap by creating a Web3-native financial platform that leverages familiar, engaging concepts from gaming (quests, rewards) and social media (community curation, personalization). By integrating investing into daily life through features like a virtual debit card and automated round-ups, STACK transforms it from a daunting task into an intuitive and automated habit.
