# **Epic Details**

## **Epic 1: Foundation & User Onboarding**

**Expanded Goal:** This epic lays the essential groundwork for the entire STACK platform. It focuses on creating a secure and scalable project structure, setting up the core Web3 components using Thirdweb, and designing a seamless onboarding flow that immediately engages new users by giving them their first taste of ownership.

---

### **Story 1.1: Project Scaffolding & Core Dependencies**

- **As a** Developer,
- **I want** a clean monorepo structure with all core dependencies and tooling installed,
- **so that** I can begin building features in a consistent and secure environment.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. A monorepo is initialized with packages for contracts, backend-api, and mobile-app.
2. Core dependencies for React Native, Etherlink integration using the **Thirdweb SDK**, and the Serverless backend are installed and configured.
3. Linters, formatters (e.g., ESLint, Prettier), and testing frameworks (e.g., Jest) are configured at the root level.
4. A basic "hello world" test passes in each package, proving the setup is correct.

---

### **Story 1.2: Basic Smart Contract for Asset Ownership**

- **As a** Developer,
- **I want** a basic smart contract deployed on the Etherlink testnet that can track fractional ownership of assets,
- **so that** we have a foundational on-chain component to build upon.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. A simple smart contract (e.g., following ERC-1155 standard) is created in the contracts package.
2. The contract includes functions for a trusted admin to mint fractional tokens representing ownership to a user's wallet address.
3. The contract is deployed to an Etherlink testnet **using the Thirdweb platform/CLI**.
4. The ownership balance of any fractional asset for any wallet address can be queried from the contract **via the Thirdweb SDK**.

### **Story 1.2a: Database Schema Initialization**

- **As a** Developer,
- **I want** the initial database schema to be created and version-controlled,
- **so that** backend services have a stable and ready database to connect to for all subsequent features.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1.  The Prisma schema defined in the architecture document is finalized and committed.
2.  A database migration is generated from the Prisma schema.
3.  A script exists to apply the migration, creating all necessary tables and relationships in a development database.

### **Story 1.3: User Sign-Up and Wallet Creation**

- **so that** I can start my investment journey without understanding complex crypto concepts.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. A user can sign up for an account using a simple method (e.g., social login or email/password).
2. Upon sign-up, a new, secure in-app wallet is generated and associated with their user account **using the Thirdweb SDK**.

4. The user's new wallet address is securely stored and is not exposed to the client unless necessary.

---

### **Story 1.4: Component-First Development Setup**

2. Core UI components are identified and listed based on the design specifications.
3. A storybook or similar component documentation system is set up.

---

### **Story 1.5: Onboarding Flow & Free Starter Slice**

- **As a** new user,
- **I want** to go through a simple onboarding flow and receive a "free starter slice" of a pre-determined asset,
- **so that** I feel immediately welcomed and can experience ownership without any risk.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. After sign-up, the user is presented with a simple, multi-step onboarding UI that explains the app's core concepts.
2. Upon completing the onboarding flow, the backend uses the **Thirdweb SDK** to trigger the smart contract to mint a small, pre-defined fractional asset to the user's wallet.
