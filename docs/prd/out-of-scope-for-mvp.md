# **Out of Scope for MVP**

To ensure a focused and timely delivery of the core product, the following features and capabilities are explicitly **out of scope** for the initial MVP launch. They may be considered for future releases.

* **Advanced Social Features:** Direct messaging between users, following/follower feeds beyond the curator model, and social leaderboards.
* **Multiple Fiat On-Ramps:** The MVP will focus on a single, streamlined method for funding. Integration with multiple payment processors (e.g., Plaid, Stripe Direct) will be a post-MVP consideration.
* **Web-Based Application:** The initial launch is exclusively a native mobile app for iOS and Android. A desktop or web-based version is not in scope.
* **Advanced Curator Analytics:** While curators can create and publish baskets, a detailed analytics and performance dashboard for curators will be developed post-MVP.
* **Expanded Asset Classes:** The MVP will launch with a curated selection of assets. Support for stocks, ETFs, or other traditional financial instruments is not included.
* **Internationalization (i18n):** The application will launch with English as the only supported language.
