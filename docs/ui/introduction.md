# Introduction

This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and visual design specifications for STACK's user interface. It serves as the foundation for visual design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience.

## Overall UX Goals & Principles

### Target User Personas

Based on the PRD, our primary user is the:

* **Gen Z "Digital Native" (ages 18-25):** Tech-savvy, active on social media, values authenticity and community. Is comfortable with Web3 concepts but may be intimidated by traditional finance.

### Usability Goals

* **Ease of Learning:** A new user should be able to sign up and make their first "Power Up" investment in under 3 minutes.  
* **Efficiency of Use:** Frequent actions like investing and checking progress should be achievable in just a few taps.  
* **Error Prevention:** The interface must be clear and provide confirmations for critical actions like spending or cashing out.  
* **Engagement:** The experience should feel rewarding and motivating, encouraging users to build consistent financial habits.

### Design Principles

1. **Clarity Over Cleverness:** Prioritize clear, simple language and visuals over complex financial jargon or overly innovative (but confusing) interactions.  
2. **Gamified Feedback:** Every core action should have a satisfying and immediate response that makes progress feel tangible and rewarding.  
3. **Progressive Disclosure:** Show users only what they need at any given moment. Keep the core interface simple, allowing users to explore more advanced features as they gain confidence.
