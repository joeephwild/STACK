# Branding & Style Guide

Visual Identity:  
The overall visual identity will be modern, clean, and high-contrast, designed to appeal to a Gen Z audience. It uses a dark-mode-first aesthetic with vibrant accent colors to create a user-friendly and engaging experience, as established by the provided reference images.

## Color Palette

The color scheme is taken directly from your reference designs.

| Color Type | Hex Code | Usage |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Primary | \#5852FF | Primary calls-to-action, interactive elements, highlights. |
| Accent | \#B9FF4B | Secondary calls-to-action (e.g., 'Top Up', 'Withdraw' buttons), positive financial indicators. |
| Neutral (Light) | \#EAE2FF | Backgrounds for cards and secondary page areas. |
| Neutral (Dark) | \#000000 (approx.) | Main app background (dark mode). |
| Text | \#FFFFFF (approx.) | Primary text color for use on dark backgrounds. |

## Typography

The font families are selected from your reference designs to ensure a modern, legible type system.

* **Primary Font (for headings):** MD Nichrome  
* **Secondary Font (for body text & UI):** Gilroy

### Proposed Type Scale

This is a standard, accessible type scale that aligns with the visual hierarchy in the reference designs.

| Element | Size (approx.) | Weight |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| H1 (e.g., Total Value) | 36px | Bold |
| H2 (e.g., Screen Titles) | 24px | Bold |
| H3 (e.g., Card Titles) | 18px | Semibold |
| Body (e.g., descriptions) | 16px | Regular |
| Small (e.g., labels) | 14px | Regular |

## Iconography

Based on the reference designs, we will use a clean, minimalist, and lightweight outlined icon style for all in-app icons, including the bottom tab bar.

## Spacing & Layout

The design will use a consistent spacing scale (based on an 8px grid) to ensure a clean, uncluttered layout with generous whitespace. All components will be aligned to a grid system for visual consistency.
