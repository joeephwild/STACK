## Goals

* **Fast Load Times:** The app should launch and load content quickly to maintain user engagement.  
* **Smooth Interactions:** All animations and transitions should run at 60fps for a premium feel.  
* **Efficient Data Usage:** The app should be mindful of users' data plans and load content efficiently.

## Design Strategies

* **Optimized Images:** All images and graphics will be optimized for mobile delivery.  
* **Progressive Loading:** Content will load progressively, with the most important information appearing first.  
* **Minimal Dependencies:** The design system will be lightweight and avoid unnecessary complexity that could impact performance.
