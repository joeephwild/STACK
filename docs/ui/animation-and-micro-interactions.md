# Animation & Micro-interactions

## Motion Principles

* **Purposeful:** Animations should guide the user's attention and provide feedback, not just be decorative.  
* **Subtle:** Motion should feel natural and not be distracting or overwhelming.  
* **Fast:** Animations should be quick (typically 200-300ms) to maintain a responsive feel.

## Key Animations

* **Button Press:** A subtle scale-down effect when a button is pressed, providing immediate tactile feedback.  
* **Card Tap:** A gentle lift or highlight effect when a card is tapped, indicating it's interactive.  
* **Screen Transitions:** Smooth slide or fade transitions between screens to maintain context and flow.  
* **Loading States:** Simple, elegant loading animations for data fetching or processing.  
* **Success Feedback:** Satisfying animations for positive actions like completing a quest or making an investment.
