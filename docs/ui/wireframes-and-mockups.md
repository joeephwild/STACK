## Key Screen Layouts

### Dashboard / 'For You' Feed

* **Purpose:** To provide the user with a personalized and dynamic entry point to the app, encouraging discovery and giving them a quick, clear overview of their portfolio's status.
* **Key Elements:**
  * A prominent, simple portfolio balance summary at the top.
  * The main body of the screen will be the scrollable, personalized "For You" feed.
  * Feed items will include: suggested 'Baskets', new 'Quests' from the battle pass, and content from 'Community Curators'.
  * A floating action button or an easily accessible icon for the AI Expert.
* **Interaction Notes:** The feed should support infinite scroll. Tapping any item in the feed will navigate the user to its respective detail screen.

### Basket Detail View

* **Purpose:** To provide a user with all the necessary information to make an informed and confident decision about investing in a specific 'Basket'.
* **Key Elements:**
  * A clear header displaying the Basket's name and icon.
  * A short, descriptive paragraph explaining the Basket's theme, strategy, and risk level (e.g., "Medium Volatility").
  * A simple, non-technical performance chart (e.g., a clean line graph).
  * A list of the individual assets contained within the Basket, showing each asset's logo, name, and percentage allocation.
  * A prominent and engaging "Power Up" button to initiate an investment.
  * **For Community Baskets:** A clearly visible section showing the curator's name, profile picture, and a link to their full profile.
* **Interaction Notes:** Tapping the "Power Up" button will launch a simple modal for the user to enter their desired investment amount.

### Quest / Battle Pass Screen

* **Purpose:** To provide a clear, engaging, and motivating interface for users to track their progress, complete challenges, and claim rewards, reinforcing positive financial habits.
* **Key Elements:**
  * A visual progression tracker at the top (e.g., a progress bar with numbered tiers) to show the user's current level in the "season" or battle pass.
  * A section for "Active Quests," showing a list of challenges the user is currently working on (e.g., "Power Up $10 this week," "Set up Round-ups," "Explore a Community Basket").
  * A section for "Completed Quests" or a "Claim Rewards" area where users can see what they've earned.
  * A clear display of potential rewards for upcoming tiers or quests to incentivize continued engagement.
* **Interaction Notes:** Tapping on a quest could show more detail or provide a shortcut to the relevant part of the app (e.g., tapping the "Set up Round-ups" quest takes the user to the Card Hub). Claiming rewards should be accompanied by a satisfying animation and confirmation.

### Card & Spending Hub

* **Purpose:** To give the user a clear and simple interface to manage their virtual debit card, track their spending, and control their automated investment features like 'Round-ups'.
* **Key Elements:**
  * A visual representation of the user's virtual debit card, with an option to securely view the full card number, expiry, and CVV.
  * A clear display of the "Spendable Balance" (funds available from loans or cashed-out investments).
  * A simple toggle switch to enable or disable the "Round-up" feature.
  * A display showing the total amount accumulated in "Round-ups" since the last investment.
  * A list of recent transactions made with the card.
  * A clear entry point or button to navigate to the "Micro-loan Hub."
* **Interaction Notes:** Accessing full card details should require biometric or PIN authentication for security. The transaction list should be scrollable and tappable to see more detail.
