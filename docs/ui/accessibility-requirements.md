# Accessibility Requirements

## Compliance Target

* **Standard:** WCAG 2.1 Level AA. This is the globally recognized standard for creating accessible digital products.

## Key Requirements

Based on the WCAG AA standard, our development will adhere to the following:

* **Visual:**  
  * **Color Contrast:** Text and interactive elements must have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 against their background.  
  * **Focus Indicators:** All interactive elements must have a clear and visible focus state.  
  * **Text Sizing:** Users must be able to resize text up to 200% without loss of content or functionality.  
* **Interaction:**  
  * **Keyboard Navigation:** All functionality must be operable through a keyboard interface.  
  * **Screen Reader Support:** The app will be built to be compatible with native mobile screen readers (VoiceOver for iOS and TalkBack for Android).  
  * **Touch Targets:** All interactive targets must be at least 44x44 pixels.  
* **Content:**  
  * **Alternative Text:** All meaningful images and icons must have descriptive alternative text.  
  * **Heading Structure:** Content will be organized with a logical heading structure.  
  * **Form Labels:** All form inputs will have clear, programmatically associated labels.

## Testing Strategy

* We will use a combination of automated checks during development and regular manual testing with screen readers and keyboard-only navigation to ensure compliance.
