# Responsiveness Strategy

## Target Devices

* **Primary:** Mobile phones (iOS and Android) with screen sizes ranging from 375px to 430px wide.  
* **Secondary:** Tablets (for future consideration, but not part of the MVP).

## Adaptation Patterns

* **Flexible Layouts:** All components will be designed to adapt to different screen sizes within the mobile range.  
* **Scalable Typography:** Text will scale appropriately based on the user's device settings and screen size.  
* **Touch-Friendly Interactions:** All interactive elements will be sized and spaced for easy touch interaction on mobile devices.
