# **STACK Product Requirements Document (PRD)**

## **Goals and Background Context**

### **Goals**

* To make investing accessible and simple for Gen Z by removing traditional jargon and high capital requirements.
* To create an engaging and habit-forming experience by integrating gamification and community-driven social features.
* To automate the investment process by seamlessly linking it to users' daily spending and income habits.
* To empower users with immediate liquidity and real-world utility for their digital assets.
* To provide personalized, AI-driven guidance that builds user confidence and financial literacy.

### **Background Context**

Gen Z represents a digitally-native generation that is largely underserved by traditional financial platforms. They often find the world of investing to be complex, intimidating, and misaligned with their social and community-driven values, creating a significant barrier to early wealth creation.

STACK addresses this gap by creating a Web3-native financial platform that leverages familiar, engaging concepts from gaming (quests, rewards) and social media (community curation, personalization). By integrating investing into daily life through features like a virtual debit card and automated round-ups, STACK transforms it from a daunting task into an intuitive and automated habit.

## **User Interface Design Goals**

### **Overall UX Vision**

The user experience will feel less like a traditional finance app and more like a modern social or gaming application. The vision is to create an interface that is visually engaging, builds confidence through radical clarity, and feels empowering. Every interaction should be simple, provide immediate feedback, and reinforce our core principles of hope, identity, and participation.

### **Key Interaction Paradigms**

* **Gamified Actions:** Core investment actions ("Power Up") will be treated as rewarding moments with satisfying visual and haptic feedback.
* **Personalized Discovery:** The primary method for discovering new investment opportunities will be through a "For You" algorithmic feed, not complex search tools or screeners.
* **Social & Identity Driven:** The interface will prominently feature "Community Curators" and allow users to visually showcase their portfolio as a "social badge" of their identity.
* **Automated & Passive:** Key features like "Round-ups" and "Payday Investing" will be "set and forget," with a simple and clear interface for managing these automations.

### **Core Screens and Views**

This is a conceptual list of the primary areas needed to fulfill the product's requirements:

* **Onboarding:** A guided setup that introduces the "free starter slice" and core concepts.
* **Dashboard / "For You" Feed:** The main screen for discovery and a simple overview of the user's portfolio.
* **Basket Detail View:** An exploratory screen to see the contents and philosophy behind a curated "Basket."
* **Quest / Battle Pass Screen:** A dedicated area to track gamified progress, streaks, and claim rewards.
* **Card & Spending Hub:** A screen to manage the virtual debit card, view transactions, and configure the "Round-up" feature.
* **Micro-loan Hub:** A simple interface to manage portfolio collateral and loan status.
* **AI Expert Interface:** A conversational or integrated UI to interact with the AI for personalized tips and education.

### **Accessibility**

* **Standard:** WCAG AA

### **Branding**

* **Status:** To be defined. A visual identity needs to be established that resonates with Gen Zâ€”likely modern, clean, dark-mode friendly, and potentially with customizable themes or elements (like the card skins).

### **Target Device and Platforms**

* **Platform:** Native Mobile App (iOS & Android)

## **Technical Assumptions**

### **Repository Structure: Monorepo**

* **Assumption:** We will use a Monorepo to manage the codebase. This will include packages for the mobile app, backend services, and smart contracts.
* **Rationale:** With a cross-platform mobile app, a shared backend, and smart contracts, a monorepo will make it significantly easier to share code (like data types and API clients), manage dependencies, and streamline the build process across the entire platform.

### **Service Architecture: Serverless**

* **Assumption:** The backend will be built using a Serverless architecture (e.g., cloud functions for API endpoints).
* **Rationale:** This approach is highly scalable, cost-effective (pay-per-use), and reduces infrastructure management overhead, making it an excellent fit for an MVP.

### **Testing Requirements: Full Testing Pyramid**

* **Assumption:** We will enforce a comprehensive testing strategy that includes Unit, Integration, and End-to-End (E2E) tests.
* **Rationale:** For a financial application handling user funds, security and reliability are non-negotiable. A full testing pyramid is the industry best practice to ensure the application is robust and functions as expected.

### **Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests**

* **Primary Blockchain:** All on-chain activities will be built for the Etherlink blockchain ecosystem.
* **Mobile Framework:** The mobile app will be built using a cross-platform framework, **React Native**, to prioritize development speed for the MVP while delivering a high-quality experience on both iOS and Android.

## **Epic List**

* **Epic 1: Foundation & User Onboarding**
  * **Goal:** To establish the core technical foundation of the application, including user accounts and the smart contract setup, while onboarding new users with an engaging, low-friction experience that includes their "free starter slice."
* **Epic 2: The Core Investment Experience**
  * **Goal:** To implement the primary investment loop, allowing users to simply and intuitively invest in curated "Baskets" and receive immediate, personalized feedback from the AI Expert.
* **Epic 3: Gamification & Automated Investing**
  * **Goal:** To drive long-term user engagement and habit formation by introducing the gamified "battle pass" system, the personalized "For You" feed, and powerful automated investment features like "Round-ups" and "Payday Investing."
* **Epic 4: Ecosystem & Advanced Utility**
  * **Goal:** To expand the platform's utility and create a community-driven ecosystem by enabling users to become "Community Curators" and leverage their assets to secure micro-loans.

* **Web-Based Application:** The initial launch is exclusively a native mobile app for iOS and Android. A desktop or web-based version is not in scope.
* **Advanced Curator Analytics:** While curators can create and publish baskets, a detailed analytics and performance dashboard for curators will be developed post-MVP.
* **Expanded Asset Classes:** The MVP will launch with a curated selection of assets. Support for stocks, ETFs, or other traditional financial instruments is not included.
* **Internationalization (i18n):** The application will launch with English as the only supported language.

## **Post-MVP Vision**

The long-term vision for STACK is to become the definitive social-financial platform for the next generation of investors. While the MVP focuses on establishing the core loop of investing, gamification, and utility, future phases will expand the ecosystem's depth and reach.

* **Phase 2: Deepening the Social Ecosystem:**
    * Introduce advanced social features, including user-to-user messaging and investment activity feeds.
    * Develop sophisticated dashboards and tools for Community Curators to grow their audience.
    * Launch community events, competitions, and leaderboards to drive engagement.
* **Phase 3: Expanding Financial Utility:**
    * Integrate additional fiat on-ramps and off-ramps to simplify cash flow.
    * Explore offering a wider range of asset classes, including traditional equities.
    * Develop more sophisticated AI-driven portfolio analysis and personalized financial planning tools.
* **Phase 4: Platform Expansion:**
    * Develop a companion web application to provide a rich, desktop-based experience.
    * Explore international expansion, including multi-language and multi-currency support.
