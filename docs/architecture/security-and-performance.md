# **Security and Performance**

  * **Security**:
      * All API traffic will be over HTTPS.
      * Authentication will use JWTs provided by Thirdweb Auth.
      * Backend services will use AWS IAM roles with least-privilege permissions.
      * All user input will be validated on the backend using a library like **Zod**.
  * **Performance**:
      * **Frontend**: NativeWind minimizes bundle size. We will use `React.lazy` for component loading and optimize image assets.
      * **Backend**: AWS Lambda ensures scalability. The RDS Proxy will manage database connections efficiently. API responses will be cached where appropriate.
