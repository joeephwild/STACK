# **Project Brief: STACK**

## **Executive Summary**

This document outlines the project brief for STACK, a gamified, Web3-native investment platform designed for the Gen Z demographic. The core problem STACK solves is that traditional investing is often perceived as complex, intimidating, and misaligned with the social and community-driven values of young, digitally-native users. The proposed solution is an intuitive, mobile-first application that transforms investing into an automated and engaging habit through features like a virtual debit card with automated "Round-ups," a gamified "battle pass" system, and community-curated investment "Baskets".

## **Problem Statement**

Gen Z represents a large, digitally-native generation that is significantly underserved by traditional financial platforms. These platforms often present a high barrier to entry through complex financial jargon, high capital requirements, and user experiences that lack the engagement and social integration this demographic expects. This intimidation factor creates a major obstacle to early wealth creation for an entire generation. Existing solutions fail to connect with Gen Z's values of authenticity, community, and digital identity.

## **Proposed Solution**

STACK will be a Web3-native financial platform that reframes investing through the familiar and engaging concepts of gaming and social media. By integrating investing into daily life via a virtual debit card and features like automated "Round-ups" and "Payday" investments, STACK converts it from a daunting task into an automated habit. The platform will feature curated, theme-based "Baskets" of assets, a gamified progression system with quests and rewards, a personalized "For You" feed for discovering opportunities, and an AI Expert to provide guidance.

    * **Frontend:** React Native.
    * **Backend:** Serverless architecture.
    * **Database:** Amazon Aurora Serverless (PostgreSQL).
    * **Blockchain:** Must be built on the Etherlink ecosystem using the Thirdweb SDK.
* **Architecture Considerations:**
    * **Repository:** A Monorepo structure will be used to manage all code.
    * **Testing:** A full testing pyramid (Unit, Integration, E2E) is required.

## **Constraints & Assumptions**
### **Constraints**
* The platform must be built on and integrate with the Etherlink blockchain ecosystem.
* The user interface must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility standards.

### **Key Assumptions**
* The target Gen Z audience will be receptive to the gamified, Web3-based approach to investing.

* **Market Adoption Risk:** The novel approach may face challenges in gaining initial user trust compared to traditional platforms.
* **Technical Risk:** The performance of the underlying blockchain could impact user experience.

* What is the go-to-market strategy for acquiring the first cohort of users?
